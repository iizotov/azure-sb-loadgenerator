# Multi-threaded load Generator for Azure Service Bus and Event Hubs 
This console app generates random payload and inserts it into an Azure Service Bus Queue or a Topic or an Azure Event Hub. Every payload message is a JSON consistsing of a UTC timestamp and a random string payload:
```json
{"dt":1513815044440,"payload":"<random string as per message size>"}
```
> Note: do not forget to add `;TransportType=Amqp` to your connection string to enforce [AMQP 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-dotnet) 

**Software prerequisites:**
1. Visual Studio 2015 (or higher)

## Running this sample
1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Open the solution, perform nuget restore and build
3. Usage:
```
.\LoadGenerator.exe

  -t, --threads             Required. (Default: 5) Threads to spawn.
  -s, --size                Required. (Default: 1024) JSON Payload size, real
                            size in bytes = 35 + size
  -m, --messagestosend      Required. (Default: 100) Messages to send in each
                            thread before termination, 0 for infinity
  -c, --connectionstring    Required. Event Hub or Service Bus Namespace
                            connection String. If Event Hub, make sure it is the
                            Namespace's connection string, not the Event Hub's
  --name                    Event Hub or Queue or Topic Name
  --checkpoint              (Default: 100) Checkpoint - log to console every N
                            messages
  -b, --batchmode           (Default: True) Checkpoint - log to console every N
                            messages
  --batchsize               (Default: 100) Checkpoint - log to console every N
                            messages

```

## Example
The following command line generates load in batches of 200 messages using 10 parallel threads, each message size is 150+35 bytes. The code will run infitinely until SIGTERM or Ctrl+C is received

```
.\LoadGenerator.exe --threads 10 --size 150 --messagestosend 0 --connectionstring "Endpoint=sb://latencytest.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=*****;TransportType=Amqp" --name eh1 --checkpoint 100 --batchmode True --batchsize 200
